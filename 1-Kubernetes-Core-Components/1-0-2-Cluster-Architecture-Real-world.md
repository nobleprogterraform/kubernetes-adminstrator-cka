### **1. Introduction and Overview**  

We’ll start with a basic overview of Kubernetes cluster architecture.  
First, we’ll look at the architecture from a high level and then drill down into each component.  
You’ll learn their roles, responsibilities, and how they’re configured.  
At the end, you’ll go through a practice test to identify various components in a cluster.  

We’ll use an analogy of ships to help understand Kubernetes.

### **2. Purpose of Kubernetes**  
Kubernetes hosts your applications as containers.  
It automates deployment, making it easy to run multiple instances and enable communication between different services.  
Many pieces work together to make this happen.

---

### **3. High-Level Kubernetes Architecture (Ship Analogy)**  
Let’s take a 10,000-foot view of the Kubernetes architecture.  

In our analogy:  
- **Cargo Ships**: These are like worker nodes, responsible for carrying containers (the applications).  
- **Control Ships**: These are like the master node, which manages and monitors the cargo ships.  

---

### **4. Worker Nodes (Cargo Ships)**  
Worker nodes are the ships that can load containers.  
Someone needs to manage loading, planning, tracking containers, and monitoring ships.  

---

### **5. Master Node (Control Ship) Responsibilities**  
The control ship (master node) manages the entire Kubernetes cluster.  
It handles:  
- Storing information about the nodes.  
- Planning container placement.  
- Monitoring nodes and containers.  

It uses several components collectively known as the **control plane components**.

---

### **6. Key Components of the Master Node**  

#### **etcd (Data Storage)**  
Information about ships and containers is stored in a key-value store called **etcd**.  
It maintains highly available data about which containers are on which nodes and when they were loaded.  

#### **Scheduler (Crane Operator)**  
The scheduler works like a crane, identifying which containers to load onto which ships based on size, capacity, and policies.  
It ensures that containers are placed correctly on worker nodes.

---

### **7. Controllers (Specialized Teams)**  
Different controllers handle specific tasks:  
- **Node Controller**: Manages nodes, onboarding new ones, and handling node failures.  
- **Replication Controller**: Ensures the right number of containers are always running.  

These controllers help keep everything running smoothly.

---

### **8. Communication Between Components**  
How do these parts communicate?  

The **Kube API Server** is the central management component.  
It orchestrates all operations and exposes the Kubernetes API, which allows:  
- External users to manage the cluster.  
- Controllers to monitor the cluster.  
- Worker nodes to communicate with the master node.

---

### **9. Containers and Runtime**  
Since Kubernetes manages containers, we need software to run them.  
This is the **container runtime engine**, like Docker or ContainerD.  
Every node in the cluster, including the master node, needs this runtime to host containerized components.

---

### **10. Worker Node Components**  

#### **Kubelet (Ship’s Captain)**  
The kubelet is like the captain of each ship.  
It:  
- Communicates with the master node.  
- Deploys and removes containers as needed.  
- Sends status reports about the node and containers back to the master node.  

#### **Kube Proxy (Communication Routes)**  
Kube Proxy sets up communication between containers on different nodes.  
It ensures that services can talk to each other across the cluster.

---

### **11. Summary**  
To summarize:  
- The **master node** manages the cluster with components like etcd, the scheduler, and controllers.  
- The **worker nodes** run containers with help from the kubelet and kube proxy.  
- Everything works together to automate and simplify application management.

We’ll dive deeper into each component in upcoming lectures.  
That’s it for now. See you in the next lecture!
