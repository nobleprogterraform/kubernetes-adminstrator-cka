Deployment
	- Deployment is a Kubernetes object that comes higher in the hierarchy of replica set and pods.
	- The deployment provides us with the capability to upgrade the underlying instances seamlessly using rolling updates, undo changes,
		and pause, and resume changes as required
	- A deployment definition file has apiVersion:apps/v1 kind:Deployment metadata (similar to others and have name and labels)
		and a spec that has template (for pod definition), replicas and selector (for creating replica set and pods
		as part of deployment definition itself)
	- kubectl get deployment
	- kubectl describe deployment dep-name
	- kubectl describe deployments
	- kubectl create deployment --image=httpd:1.4-alpine httpd-frontend --replicas=3 (replicas only in k8s versin 1.19+only)
		--dry-run=client -o yaml > new-dep.yaml
	- kubectl create -f new-dep.yaml
	- To edit the deployment: kubectl edit deployment deployment-name, update the deployment and save the file will edit the deployment
