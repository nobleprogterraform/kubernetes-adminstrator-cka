2.1 Cluster Architecture
	- We start with a basic overview of the Kubernetes cluster architecture.
		The purpose of Kubernetes is to host your applications in the form of containers in an automated fashion so that you can easily deploy
		as many instances of your application
		The Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of nodes, which may be physical or virtual, on premise or on cloud, that host applications in the form of containers. 
		
		The master node is responsible for managing the Kubernetes cluster, storing information regarding the different nodes,
		planning which containers goes where, monitoring the nodes and containers on them, et cetera.The master node does all of these using a set
		of components together known as the control playing components
		
		Etcd is a database that stores information in a key value format.We will look more into what etcd cluster actually is,
		what data is stored in it, and how it stores the data
		
		A scheduler identifies the right node to place a container on based on the containers resource requirements,
		the worker nodes capacity or any other policies or constraints, such as taints

		The node controller takes care of nodes. They're responsible for onboarding new nodes to the cluster,
		handling situations where nodes become unavailable or get destroyed, and the replication controller ensures
		that the desired number of containers are running
		
		The Kube API server is the primary management component of Kubernetes. The Kube API server is responsible
		for orchestrating all operations within the cluster. It exposes the Kubernetes API, which is used by external users
		to perform management operations on the cluster
		
		So we need these software that can run containers and that's the container runtime engine,a popular one being Docker.
		So we need Docker, or it's supported equivalent installed on all the nodes in the cluster, including the master nodes, if you wish
		to host the controlling components as containers
		
		A kubelet is an agent that runs on each node in a cluster. It listens for instructions from the Kube API server
		and deploys or destroys containers on the nodes as required
		
		Communication between worker nodes are enabled by another component that runs
		on the worker node known as the Kube Proxy Service. The Kube Proxy Service ensures that the necessary rules are
		in place on the worker nodes to allow the containers running on them to reach each other.
		
		So to summarize, we have master and worker nodes. On the master, we have the etcd cluster,
		which stores information about the cluster. We have the cube scheduler that is responsible
		for scheduling applications or containers on nodes. We have different controllers that take care
		of different functions like the node controller, replication controller, et cetera.
		We have the Kube API server that is responsible for orchestrating all operations within the cluster.
		
		On the worker node, we have the kubelet that listens for instructions from the Kube API server
		and manages containers and the Kube Proxy that helps in enabling communication between services within the cluster.


  2.3 ETCD for beginners
  - ETCD is a distributed, reliable, key-value store that is simple, secure, and fast
	- When you run ETCD, it starts a service that listens on port 2379 by default.
		You can then attach any clients to the ETCD service to store and retrieve information.
		A default client that comes with ETCD is the ETCDCTL client. 
		The ETCDCTL client is a command line client for ETCD.
		You can use it to store and retrieve key-value pairs

  ETCD in Kubernetes
    In this lecture, we will talk about etcd's role in Kubernetes.
		The etcd data store stores information regarding the cluster such as the nodes, pods, configs, secrets, accounts, roles,
		role bindings, and others.
		Every information you see when you run the kube control get command is from the etcd server
		Every change you make to your cluster such as adding additional nodes, deploying pods 
		or replica sets are updated in the etcd server
    If you set up your cluster using kubeadm,then kubeadm deploys the etcd server for you as a pod
		in the kube system namespace (you can get this pod info using kubectl get pods -n kube-system)

		kubectl exec -n=kube-system etcd-controlplane -- etcdctl version
		

		kubectl exec etcd-controlplane -n kube-system -- sh -c "etcdctl get / --prefix --keys-only --limit=10 --cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt --cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt  --key /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key" 



		## Questions
	Here are some questions you might anticipate from experienced DevOps engineers, along with concise answers:

---

### **1. What makes etcd different from a traditional database?**  
- **Answer**: Unlike traditional relational databases, etcd is a distributed key-value store. It stores data as key-value pairs instead of rows and columns, making it ideal for configuration data and state management in distributed systems like Kubernetes. Changes to one key-value pair do not impact others.

---

### **2. How does etcd ensure high availability and consistency?**  
- **Answer**: etcd uses the **RAFT consensus algorithm** to maintain consistency across nodes in a cluster. It ensures that data is replicated to multiple nodes and only committed when a majority (quorum) agrees. This provides fault tolerance and consistency.

---

### **3. What are some best practices for setting up an etcd cluster?**  
- **Answer**:  
  - Deploy an odd number of nodes (typically 3 or 5) to prevent split-brain scenarios.  
  - Ensure network reliability and low latency between nodes.  
  - Regularly back up etcd data.  
  - Use TLS for secure communication between etcd nodes and clients.

---

### **4. How does the API version affect etcdctl commands?**  
- **Answer**: etcdctl supports two major API versions: v2 and v3. The commands differ between these versions:  
  - **v2**: Uses `set` and `get` commands.  
  - **v3**: Uses `put` and `get` commands.  
Check the API version by running `etcdctl version`. To switch to v3, set the environment variable `ETCDCTL_API=3`.

---

### **5. What happens if an etcd node fails?**  
- **Answer**: If a node fails, etcd continues operating as long as a quorum (majority of nodes) is available. The failed node can be replaced or recovered, and the cluster will replicate data to it once it rejoins.

---

### **6. Why is etcd critical in a Kubernetes cluster?**  
- **Answer**: etcd stores the entire state of a Kubernetes cluster, including configuration data, secrets, and service discovery details. Kubernetes components rely on etcd to retrieve and update the desired cluster state.

---

### **7. What security measures should be implemented for etcd?**  
- **Answer**:  
  - Use **TLS encryption** for communication between nodes and clients.  
  - Enable **authentication** and **role-based access control (RBAC)**.  
  - Restrict access to etcd to only trusted clients and nodes.

---

### **8. Can you explain the difference between linearizability and eventual consistency in etcd?**  
- **Answer**: etcd provides **linearizability**, meaning read and write operations are guaranteed to reflect the most recent state. This differs from **eventual consistency**, where updates might take time to propagate across nodes.

---

### **9. How do you back up and restore etcd data?**  
- **Answer**: Use the `etcdctl snapshot save <filename>` command to back up data and `etcdctl snapshot restore <filename>` to restore. It’s crucial to perform backups regularly, especially before major Kubernetes upgrades.

---

### **10. What impact does network latency have on an etcd cluster?**  
- **Answer**: High network latency can slow down consensus operations, affecting write performance and potentially causing timeouts. It’s critical to deploy etcd nodes in a low-latency, reliable network environment.

---

These questions and answers cover technical aspects DevOps engineers are likely to ask, focusing on etcd’s role, configuration, and best practices in a Kubernetes environment.
