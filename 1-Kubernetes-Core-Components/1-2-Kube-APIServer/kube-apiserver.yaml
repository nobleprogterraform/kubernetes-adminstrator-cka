Kube-API server
	- Earlier, we discussed that the kube-apiserver is the primary management component in Kubernetes. When you run a kubectl command,
		the kubectl utility is in fact reaching to the kube-apiserver
	- Let's look at an example of creating a pod.When you do that, as before,the request is authenticated first and then validated.
		In this case, the API server creates a pod object without assigning it to a node. Updates the information in the etcd server,
		updates the user that the pod has been created. The scheduler continuously monitors the API server 
		and realizes that there is a new pod with no node assigned. The scheduler identifies the right node to place the new pod on
		and communicates that back to the kube-apiserver.
		The API server then updates the information in the etcd cluster.
		The API server then passes that information to the kubelet in the appropriate worker node.
		The kubelet then creates the pod on the node and instructs the container runtime engine to deploy the application image.
		Once done, the kubelet updates the status back to the API server and the API server then updates the data back in the etcd cluster.
		A similar pattern is followed every time a change is requested
	-   The kube-apiserver is run with a lot of parameters, There are different modes of authentication, 
		authorization, encryption and security. And that's why you have so many options.
		A lot of them are certificates that are used to secure the connectivity between different components
	- So how do you view the kube-apiserver options in an existing cluster?
		If you set it up with a kubeadmin tool,
		the kubeadmin deploys the kubeadmin-apiserver as a pod in the kube-system namespace on the master node(kubectl get pods -n kube-system).
		You can see the options within the pod definition file, located at etc/kubernetes/manifest folder.
		You can also see the running process and the effective options by listing the process 
		on the master node and searching for kube-apiserver. By running ps -aux | grep kube-apiserver



		=============
		Here are some questions experienced DevOps engineers might ask about the kube-apiserver, along with concise answers:

### 2. **How does the kube-apiserver interact with etcd?**  
   - **Answer:** The kube-apiserver is the only component that directly communicates with etcd. It retrieves, updates, and stores cluster state and configuration data in etcd.

### 3. **How is a new pod created and scheduled in Kubernetes?**  
   - **Answer:**  
     - The kube-apiserver receives the request and authenticates it.  
     - It creates the pod object in etcd but does not assign it to a node.  
     - The scheduler monitors for unscheduled pods, assigns a node, and updates the kube-apiserver.  
     - The kube-apiserver informs the kubelet, which creates the pod on the assigned node and deploys the container.  
     - The kubelet updates the pod status back to the kube-apiserver.

### 4. **How can you view kube-apiserver options in an existing cluster?**  
   - **Answer:**  
     - If using **kubeadm**, check the pod definition file at `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml`.  
     - For non-kubeadm setups, view the service file at `/etc/systemd/system/kube-apiserver.service`.  
     - Alternatively, list running processes using `ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver`.

### 5. **What are some important kube-apiserver configuration options?**  
   - **Answer:** Key options include:  
     - `--etcd-servers`: Specifies the etcd server endpoints.   
     - `--authorization-mode`: Defines authorization methods (e.g., RBAC).  
     - `--tls-cert-file` and `--tls-private-key-file`: Specify SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication.

### 6. **How does the kube-apiserver ensure security?**  
   - **Answer:** It uses SSL/TLS certificates to encrypt communication between components. It also supports authorization modes (RBAC, ABAC).

### 7. **Can you interact with the kube-apiserver without `kubectl`?**  
   - **Answer:** Yes, you can interact directly with the kube-apiserver by sending HTTP/HTTPS requests to its REST API using tools like `curl` or Postman.

### 8. **What happens if the kube-apiserver fails?**  
   - **Answer:** The cluster becomes read-only. You can still access existing resources, but no new resources can be created or updated until the kube-apiserver is restored.

### 9. **How does the scheduler and kube-apiserver coordinate?**  
   - **Answer:** The scheduler watches the kube-apiserver for unscheduled pods. Once it assigns a pod to a node, it updates the kube-apiserver, which then informs the kubelet on the respective node.

### 10. **What is the role of certificates in the kube-apiserver?**  
   - **Answer:** Certificates secure communication between the kube-apiserver and other components, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.
